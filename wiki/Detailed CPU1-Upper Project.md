# How to Create From Scratch a Project for _CPU1-Upper_ Code #

The main CPU (aka. _CPU1 Discovery_) firmware is splitted in two parts:
- The proper _CPU1 Discovery_ firmware, with the main code.
- The _protected upper memory_ firmware, which is programmed during _OSTC4_ production, and contains (amongst other things) code used to upload and install firmware upgrades.

## Make a specific project ##

Follow the same procedure than for [CPU1-Discovery](Detailed CPU1-Discovery Project.md), (same processor, same includes) but include the `CPU1-Upper` source directory.
